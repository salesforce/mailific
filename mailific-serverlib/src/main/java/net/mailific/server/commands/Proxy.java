/**
 * Implements the PROXY protocol https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt
 * used by HAProxy and nginx to pass client connection information.
 * nginx supports the PROXY protocol when it proxies a mail server, but to do things like
 * SPF, we need to know the original client IP address.
 *
 * This command collects the client IP address from the PROXY command and stores it in
 * the SESSION_CLIENTIP_PROPERTY property of the session.
 * (Perhaps at some point we should add the ability to change the remote address of the
 * SmtpSession.)
