/**
 * Interface for an SMTP Extension as described in rfc 1425.
 *
 * <p>Extensions do their work by (a) advertising their presence and (b) supplying new or overridden
 * {@link CommandHandler}s. (In the future, it might be nice to have an easy way for them to just
 * add parameter-processors to existing commands.)
 *
 * <p>Note that a single instance of the Extension is used to serve all requests, so it should be
 * stateless, immutable, and thread-safe. The same is true for any CommandHandler it supplies. If
 * you need to keep state, use {@link SmtpSession#setProperty(String, Object)} to store it in the
 * session.
 *
 * <p>The CommandHandlers you supply are installed in the SmtpSessionFactory once and used for all
 * sessions. That means your handler will be used even when your extension is not available. So if
 * necessary, the CommandHandler should start every command invocation by checking whether the
 * extended functionality is allowed/needed and, if not, fall back to default behavior. A future
 * release will make it possible for an Extension's CommandHandler to pass on a command to any
 * handler it overrode.
